    "# Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will\n",
    "\n",
    "* apply standard preprocessing techniques on Wikipedia text data\n",
    "* use GraphLab Create to fit a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model\n",
    "* explore and interpret the results, including topic keywords and topic assignments for documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a major feature distinguishing the LDA model from our previously explored methods is the notion of *mixed membership*. Throughout the course so far, our models have assumed that each data point belongs to a single cluster. k-means determines membership simply by shortest distance to the cluster center, and Gaussian mixture models suppose that each data point is drawn from one of their component mixture distributions. In many cases, though, it is more realistic to think of data as genuinely belonging to more than one cluster or category - for example, if we have a model for text data that includes both \"Politics\" and \"World News\" categories, then an article about a recent meeting of the United Nations should have membership in both categories rather than being forced into just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we will use GraphLab Create tools to fit an LDA model to a corpus of Wikipedia articles and examine the results to analyze the impact of a mixed membership approach. In particular, we want to identify the topics discovered by the model in terms of their most important words, and we want to use the model to predict the topic membership distribution for a given document.

    "In the original data, each Wikipedia article is represented by a URI, a name, and a string containing the entire text of the article. Recall from the video lectures that LDA requires documents to be represented as a _bag of words_, which ignores word ordering in the document but retains information on how many times each word appears. As we have seen in our previous encounters with text data, words such as 'the', 'a', or 'and' are by far the most frequent, but they appear so commonly in the English language that they tell us almost nothing about how similar or dissimilar two documents might be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, before we train our LDA model, we will preprocess the Wikipedia data in two steps: first, we will create a bag of words representation for each article, and then we will remove the common words that don't help us to distinguish between documents. For both of these tasks we can use pre-implemented tools from GraphLab Create:"

As a preliminary check on the results of applying this method, it is reasonable to hope that the model has been able to learn topics that correspond to recognizable categories. In order to do this, we must first recall what exactly a 'topic' is in the context of LDA. \n",

Looking at the highest probability words in each topic will thus give us a sense of its major themes. Ideally we would find that each topic is identifiable with some clear theme _and_ that all the topics are relatively distinct.\n",

    "From these two plots we can see that the low gamma model results in higher weight placed on the top words and lower weight placed on the bottom words for each topic, while the high gamma model places relatively less weight on the top words and more weight on the bottom words. Thus increasing gamma results in topics that have a smoother distribution of weight across all the words in the vocabulary."

    "We have now seen how the hyperparameters alpha and gamma influence the characteristics of our LDA topic model, but we haven't said anything about what settings of alpha or gamma are best. We know that these parameters are responsible for controlling the smoothness of the topic distributions for documents and word distributions for topics, but there's no simple conversion between smoothness of these distributions and quality of the topic model. In reality, there is no universally \"best\" choice for these parameters. Instead, finding a good topic model requires that we be able to both explore the output (as we did by looking at the topics and checking some topic predictions for documents) and understand the impact of hyperparameter settings (as we have in this section)."
